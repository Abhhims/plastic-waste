              "What Are Plastic Credits?"
              Plastic credits are a certified system that quantifies the collection and recycling of plastic waste. Each credit symbolizes one ton of plastic removed from the environment, providing companies with an actionable way to meet sustainability targets. By investing in plastic credits, businesses take real steps to offset their environmental footprint and contribute to the global fight against plastic pollution.
